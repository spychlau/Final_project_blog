  Some additional details about the blog

The data used to generate the visualization in this blog was made public in the GitHub repository connected to this blog. However, notice that this is synthetic data.

All scales consist of multiple items which were averaged. All items (except vofrequ) were measured on a scale from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree").

I recruited participants via https://www.prolific.co/

Participants were supervisors who were asked to select one of their employees to base the survey on him/her.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
