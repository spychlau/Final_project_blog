    "description": "The goal is to generate a table that allows the reader to search for variables by their acronym, get an exlpanation what a variable measures as well as mean and standard deviation. I want to produce a table with more information on each variable so that you can just easily look up a variable. Such a table would be for everyone interested in the data set.",

    "description": "Correlation matrices are ubiquitous when dealing with survey data. However, most of them are very simple because they display all correlations without distinctions and do not use any highlighting features. Therefore, my aim is here to create a fun correlation table that makes it easier for researchers who are interested in the data set to identify interesting correlations that are not discussed in the results section of a paper.",

    "description": "THere are other, more fun ways of displaying correlations than in tables. Specifically, I had been wondering if I can display them in a network-like fashion. As I realized, there are a number of ways to do that. There aren't as many options for undirected paths such as correlations as there are for directed paths (when you have parental nodes) but there are still some fun ways!",
